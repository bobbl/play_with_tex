> Experiments with the original TeX source code from Donald E. Knuth


Compile the original TeX source code with Free Pascal
-----------------------------------------------------

In CTAN [Don Knuth's source code for TeX](https://ctan.org/pkg/knuth-dist) can be found.
With the help of [Wolfgang Helbig's TeX-FPC package](https://ctan.org/pkg/tex-fpc) it
can be compiled with a current version of Free Pascal. Because it's not all that simple,
here are some instructions and a script to download and compile TeX.
